# Fraud Detection

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a system to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time using historical transaction data. By accurately identifying fraudulent transactions, businesses can prevent significant financial losses and improve overall security. The project demonstrates skills in anomaly detection, supervised learning, unsupervised learning, feature engineering, and handling imbalanced datasets.

## Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collect and preprocess data related to transaction history, including transaction amounts, times, and user information. Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.

- **Data Sources:** Historical transaction data, user information, transaction metadata.
- **Techniques Used:** Data cleaning, normalization, handling missing values, feature engineering.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Perform EDA to understand the data distribution, identify patterns, and gain insights into the factors contributing to fraud.

- **Techniques Used:** Data visualization, summary statistics, correlation analysis.

### 3. Feature Engineering
Create new features based on existing data to capture essential aspects of transactions that may indicate fraud.

- **Techniques Used:** Feature extraction, transformation, and selection.

### 4. Model Building
Develop and evaluate different models to detect fraudulent transactions. Compare their performance to select the best model.

- **Techniques Used:** Logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks.

### 5. Handling Imbalanced Datasets
Address the issue of imbalanced datasets where fraudulent transactions are much less frequent than legitimate ones.

- **Techniques Used:** Resampling techniques (oversampling, undersampling), synthetic data generation (SMOTE).

### 6. Anomaly Detection
Implement unsupervised learning techniques to detect anomalies in the transaction data.

- **Techniques Used:** Clustering, isolation forests, autoencoders.
